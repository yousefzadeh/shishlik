- Started with synapse on its own server, was costing thousands per month  
- Strategy  
  - Big part is multi-region, whatever architecture needs to be able to be rolled out to different regions. Keep costs efficient  
  - Doing more AI stuff, vector databases  
  - Any nlp use cases?  
    - Could see that happening. Next 3-6 months lots of similarity searches. Not much training  
- Flagship regions AU and UK  
- Analytics across regions is not possible right now  
  - Raw data can’t go out of the region  
- 26 plan  
  - Before we proceed any further, let’s make sure we evaluate these options  
  - Let’s sort out the decision first  
    - Framework for making the data warehouse direction:   
      - synapse vs. databricks vs. fabric  
      - What are principles, criteria and requirements  
        - Cost  
        - Security  
        - Team skills  
        - Maintenance  
        -   
    - Does it scale across different regions  
      - Can the cost be manageable  
      - Is it appropriate for this solution?  
    - tentantId and partitioning  
      - The one we currently have is the spoke, and the hub can access those
